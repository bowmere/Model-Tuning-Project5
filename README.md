# Model-Tuning-Project5
Developed and optimized classification models, including Logistic Regression, Bagging, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and AdaBoost, to predict generator failures in wind turbines. Model comparisons focused on Recall performance metric to minimize false negatives and prevent unplanned machine downtime.
